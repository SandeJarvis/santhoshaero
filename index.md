  <div class="pill">About Me</div>
  <h1>Hello, I’m Santhosh.</h1>
  <p class="sub">Aerospace engineer exploring aerodynamics, CFD, and conceptual design of aircraft and UAVs.</p>

  <p>I’m passionate about understanding how air interacts with shape and motion — the core of every aerodynamic challenge. My work spans across CFD analysis, conceptual aircraft design, and experimental flow studies. I’ve been part of research and product teams working on eVTOL systems, plasma-flow interactions, and design validation, giving me a wide perspective on both numerical and practical aspects of flight.</p>

  <p>This site serves as my digital engineering diary — a place where I share ongoing ideas, design tools, and explorations in internal and external fluid dynamics. It’s continually evolving as I document new insights and develop small utilities for aerodynamic and design calculations.</p>
