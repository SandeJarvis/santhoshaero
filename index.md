  <div class="pill">About Me</div>
  <h1>Hello, I’m Santhosh.</h1>
  <p class="sub">Aerospace engineer exploring aerodynamics, CFD, and conceptual design of aircraft and UAVs.</p>
  <p>I’m passionate about understanding how air interacts with shape and motion—the core of aerodynamic performance and stability. My work spans CFD analysis, conceptual aircraft design, and experimental flow studies, combining physical intuition with practical engineering.</p>
  <p>This site is my digital engineering diary—a place where I share ideas, tools, and evolving thoughts in aerodynamics, internal and external flows, and practical design approaches.</p>
